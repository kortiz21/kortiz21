# About Me
Hello, my name is Kevin Ortiz and I'm a fourth year Computer Science student and Field Service Engineer with a passion for technology and innovation. I have gained professional experience in hospitality, information technology and full-stack development via work experience and an internship at NTERSOL. With one year of experience in the tech industry, I've had the opportunity to work on a exciting project that has allowed me to develop a broad range of skills, including leadership skills, agile development experience, object-oriented analysis, design and high level programming.

I specialize in C++ programming, and I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to apply my knowledge and skills to solve complex problems. I'm a firm believer in the power of technology to make the world a better place, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and tools to help me achieve that goal.

When I'm not working on tech projects, I enjoy playing and creating video games. I find that these activities help me stay creative and keep my mind sharp, which is essential in the fast-paced world of tech.
